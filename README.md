# COAWST Project
This project attempts to recreate the COAWST visualization in a python environment, making it more user friendly in the process. Taking current data about the ocean surface temperature, surface height, sediment distribution, and significant wave height, COAWST creates a visual representation of the data.

Using Folium, a python plugin, we are hoping to create a more robust version of the current version. Over the course of the summer, this program will continue to be updated and a final version is ready for release.
